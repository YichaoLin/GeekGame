GeekGame
It is built for software engineers or CS amateurs
to share their knowledge and make friends. As other websites, you can register to be a new user, login in and login out. When you register, you are only required to fill in some basic information, after you become a user, you may add your education experience and work experience, we list all your work experience and education experience in your account so you can see them very clearly, you can also delete any of your experience. You can also view all people who register in this website, and you can see detail information of them, for example, you can see the description of their project, what they do in their company and so on.. Anyone are welcomed to post opinion in the “comment” block, and you can like and unlike others’ opinion and make a comment. 
For the website, I use the react plus redux to finish the front end development. I use Node.js for the backend and Mongo DB for the database.
